### Gaps Identified

- Security and Vulnerability Management:

The absence of comprehensive security scanning represents the highest-priority gap, particularly given PICongpu's role in processing sensitive research data and managing high-value computational resources. Python security analysis through Bandit implementation would address critical vulnerabilities in the extensive Python ecosystem, while multi-language security analysis through Bearer would provide comprehensive vulnerability detection across the C++, CUDA, and Python codebase architecture.

- Research Integration and Discoverability:

Missing standardized metadata formats significantly limit integration with modern research infrastructure. `CITATION.cff` implementation would enable automated citation generation across GitHub, GitLab, Zenodo, and research platforms, while `codemeta.json` would enhance software discoverability in research repositories and academic catalogs. These gaps reduce research impact and limit collaborative opportunities within the scientific computing community.

- Quality Assurance and Certification:

The absence of formal quality assessment through SQAaaS and systematic FAIR compliance validation through howfairis and F-UJI reduces third-party recognition and certification capabilities. These gaps affect collaboration agreement facilitation and academic credibility enhancement for critical research infrastructure.

- Automation and Metadata Management:

Missing automated metadata management through SOMEF and Somesy creates manual maintenance overhead and potential consistency issues across multiple platforms and documentation systems. Automated metadata publication through Hermes workflows would enhance research software discoverability and academic impact measurement.
